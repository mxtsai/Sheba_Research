## Good Articles



## Not-So-Good Articles
* [Identification and classification of brain tumor MRI images with feature extraction using DWT and probabilistic neural network](https://github.com/mxtsai/Sheba_Research/blob/master/Papers/40708_2017_Article_75.pdf)
  * using probabilistic neural network instead of CNN, methods seem old and the accuracy doesn't seem realistic
